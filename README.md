# BulletHost Promo Codes and Latest BulletHost Affordable Hosting Deals for 2026

## BulletHost Introduction

So, there's this hosting company called BulletHost. Started under Bullet Group LTD back in 2017, they didn't really jump into the public hosting game until late 2018. Picture this: they began with just a couple of rented servers, nothing fancy. But here's the thing—within a year, they were doing well enough to buy their own hardware. Now that's commitment.

By 2019, they'd rebranded from "Cloudwall Hosting" to BulletHost and started expanding beyond basic web hosting into VPS, dedicated servers, and even RDP services. Today, they own 100% of their hardware, which is colocated in data centers across Europe—specifically in the Netherlands and Bulgaria. They use enterprise-grade hardware from brands like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell, so you're getting quality stuff without the corporate price tag.

What makes them different? Well, they're not trying to be some massive corporate entity. They actually talk to their customers like regular people. Their whole philosophy is built around transparency, customizable solutions, and taking customer feedback seriously. Need a custom VPS configuration? They'll work with you on it. Want to pay with cryptocurrency for anonymity? They accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin alongside traditional payment methods.

Their services include LiteSpeed-powered web hosting with DirectAdmin, KVM VPS (which means your resources aren't shared with other users), reseller hosting options for those wanting to start their own hosting business, and dedicated servers for heavy workloads. They also throw in free DDoS protection using Radware Defense Pro 720, free SSL certificates, and free migration for new customers.

The support team is available 24/7 through tickets, live chat, email, and even Telegram. Most responses come in under 2 hours, which is pretty solid. And if you're worried about uptime, they maintain a 99% uptime guarantee.
